The idea is to build a SaaS, that will enable Influencers to have a place to sell their products.
A Influencer will create an account with us and he/she will receive an Endpoint that can be redirected though a domain. The subdomain of the endpoint will tell, from which client is the store.
Then the store will be an amazon-like.
